# [IIS Server Configs](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-iis)

## Maintained Versions

Older versions may contain configuration within the httpRuntime/TargetFramework that don't match your current set-up. Most of the config is taken from later versions and subsequently is meant to be used to provide configuration you can integrate into your own.

The server config targets IIS7+ where replacement config is available for IIS8 (or simplification) it will be marked.

Pull requests to old and new versions are appreciated.
